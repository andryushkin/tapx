# Privacy Policy for TapX

*Last updated: February 2026*

TapX ("the Extension") is a browser extension for Google Chrome that removes visible gaps between split-image posts on X (Twitter).

## Data collection

TapX does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data or user information. The extension does not track browsing history, page content, clicks, or any other user activity.

## Local storage

The extension stores a single on/off preference (`isEnabled`) in the browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`). This value never leaves the user's device.

## Third parties

TapX does not integrate any analytics, advertising, or third-party services. No data is sold or transferred to any third party under any circumstances.

## Permissions

The extension requests only the permissions necessary to function:

- `activeTab` and host permissions for x.com / twitter.com — to detect and fix split-image layouts on tweet pages.
- `storage` — to remember the user's on/off toggle setting.

## Contact

If you have questions about this policy, please open an issue at the extension's GitHub repository.
