TapX removes the distracting gaps between split-image ("puzzle") posts on X / Twitter — automatically, with zero clicks.

When artists post multi-panel illustrations or creators use the "tap to view" post format as 2–4 vertical image tiles, X's grid layout forces visible white spacing between each piece. TapX patches that in real time so every puzzle post looks like one seamless, continuous artwork — exactly as the creator intended.

**What TapX does:**
• Instantly removes gaps between split images on X and Twitter
• Works automatically on tweet pages — no settings, no toggles
• Detects vertical puzzle layouts; leaves galleries and panoramas untouched
• One-click Stitch & Download: exports the full image in original 4K quality
• Lightweight — no background processes, no data collected

**Who it's for:**
• Digital artists and illustrators who post multi-panel puzzle content
• Creators using the "tap to view" multi-panel format
• Fans and collectors who want to save artwork in full resolution
• Anyone tired of broken-up visuals interrupting their feed

**How it works:**
TapX uses stable X.com selectors to detect multi-image tweet layouts. When a vertical puzzle is found, it rebuilds the display as a seamless grid — no flicker, no layout breakage. Hit the stitch button to merge all panels into a single 4K image and save it locally.
